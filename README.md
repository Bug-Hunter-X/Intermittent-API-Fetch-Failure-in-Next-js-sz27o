# Next.js Intermittent API Fetch Failure

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where an API route intermittently fails, leading to an inconsistent user experience.  The problem stems from the API route randomly returning either a successful response or a 500 error.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` API route simulates a scenario where an API call randomly succeeds or fails. This unpredictable behavior causes the frontend component (`components/MyComponent.js`) to sometimes display an error message ('Failed to fetch data!') instead of the expected data.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling and potentially retry logic to handle these transient failures.  The improved code provides a better user experience by gracefully handling the error and retrying the fetch if necessary.
